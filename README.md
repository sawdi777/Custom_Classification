# Custom_Classification
this is a Classification (Machine Learning) python script that includes two different datasets (iris &amp; two_moons) for the user to choose, the user can also choose the rate of test data. There are also 4 different classification to choose from. 
The first one is K Nearest Neighbor, this method includes the automatic search for the best amount to use as K, which is a very important parameter to tune.
The second one is SVM, in SVM we test all three kernels of it in order to get better results, the kernels used are rbf, linear and poly.
The third one is Decision Tree, which i truely LOVE, we get three different results that represent three different depths which is an important parameter to tune in DT.
The third one is the classic Naive Bayes aka GaussianNB.
all the results will include their related plot and classification report
